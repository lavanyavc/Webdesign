            <div class="box1">The Indian Space Research Organization 
                successfully launched another mission to 
                the moon with Chandrayaan 3. This is the 
                ISRO’s follow-up on India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2, which 
                was launched on July 22 from Sriharikota.
                        <p>
                            Chadrayaan-3 is India’s third lunar mission, which is aimed at achieving a successful landing of the lander on the moon’s 
                            surface. This mission is being conducted 
                            because of Chandrayaan-2, which took 
                            48 days to reach the moon’s surface, but 
                            later failed after the Vikram lunar lander 
                            crashed on the moon’s surface.</p>
                            <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched Chandrayaan 3 on the 14th of July at around 
                            2:35 PM. Chandrayaan-3 was launched 
                            from Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, India.

                         <p>
                            In order to investigate the lunar surface 
                            plasma environment, elemental composition, seismicity, and thermophysical 
                            properties, the Chandrayaan-3 mission 
                            will transport scientific instruments to the 
                            moon.

                <p>
                    The Chandrayaan-3 mission is an ambitious project of the Indian Space Research 
                    Organization. The primary objective of 
                    this mission is to put a lander and rover 
                    in the highlands near the south pole of the 
                    Moon and demonstrate end-to-end landing and roving capabilities
                </p>
                <p>
                        Chandrayaan-3 is the follow-up mission 
                        to Chandrayaan-2. Chandrayaan 3 will 
                        consist of an indigenous Lander module 
                        (LM), a Propulsion module (PM), and a 
                        Rover.

                        Chandrayaan-3 which is the most anticipated project of the Indian Space Organization (ISRO) will be launched soon. As 
                        Chandrayaan-3 was the follow-up project 
                        for Chandrayaan-2, the whole cost of the 
                        mission is Rs. 615 Crore.

                        Whereas, the budget for the Chandrayaan-2 
                        mission was Rs. 978 Crore which included 
                        Rs. 603 crore for the orbiter, lander, rover, 
                        navigation, and ground support network 
                        and Rs 375 crore for Geo-stationary Satellite Launch Vehicle.
